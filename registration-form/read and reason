--- B-1: Hoisting Surprise ---

Console Output:
undefined
42

Explanation:
The variable `value` is declared using `var`, which is hoisted to the top of the function.
So on line ①, `value` exists but is undefined.
After the assignment inside the `if`, line ② logs `42`.


--- B-2: Temporal Dead Zone ---

Console Output:
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'theme' before initialization

Explanation:
`const theme` is in the Temporal Dead Zone from the start of the block until its declaration.
Accessing it before it's initialized causes a ReferenceError, even though the destructuring has a default value.
